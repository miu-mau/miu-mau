**Who Am I?**
</div>

<div align="justify">

I am a student of `Backend-developer` at the `ITHUB academy`. My immersion in this field began spontaneously: closer to 15, when passing exams and choosing a future profession I stopped at IT, although in my circle and family no one did it, I still felt sincere interest in it and risked to do it. 

To my joy my desire was not wrong, at first I studied as a programmer, but then decided that for the moment `Back-end` will be more interesting for me. Now Iâ€™m 19 years old and Iâ€™m in my fourth year of college and in the future Iâ€™m going to go to university to increase my knowledge and can get more education.
